# Project - Machine Learning â€“Airlines Passengers Satisfaction: 
Classical Predictive Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to find the best algorithm/model to efficiently predict satisfaction of U.S based airline passengers using a survey data.

## Workflow
1.Came up with a few research questions in mind.

2.Collected Datasets, cleaning up and preprocessing done.

3.Explored data to understand the trends and patterns in data.

4.Trained the prediction model using different algorithms to come up with the best fit.

## Content
The dataset for analysis is extracted from Kaggle and is based on survey data taken from around 130K passengers in an U.S airline.

The train and test files were available separately but I have concatenated them and split it later in my analysis.

Data is available here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d_hOJd6K_XukZp9uxMqKPOh2SD_IBouB
